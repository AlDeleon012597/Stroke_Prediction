# Stroke_Prediction

In this analysis we will attempt to predict whether or not a patient will have a stroke based on a number of characteristics. This dataset is interesting to me because two of my family members had strokes in my youth. Other family members almost had one. Because of this I seeking to know from a statistical perspective, what are some predictors of strokes?

I found this dataset on kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset. The data source is "confidential". This dataset contains information on patients who had (or did not have) a stroke. Patient information includes gender, body mass index, average glucose level, residence type, if the patient is a smoker, and so on.
